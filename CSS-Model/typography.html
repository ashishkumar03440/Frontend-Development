      <h2>The Art of Good Typography</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Typography</strong> is not just about choosing fonts — it’s about creating a visual rhythm that guides the reader’s eyes.
        A well-chosen <em>font family</em> and balanced spacing can make a world of difference. 
        Designers often experiment with <mark>contrast</mark> in size, weight, and style to create hierarchy and harmony in their layouts.
      </p>

      <p>
        In modern web design, using <strong>readable fonts</strong> such as 
        <em>sans-serif</em> families improves legibility on screens. 
        Proper <mark>line-height</mark> ensures comfortable reading, while subtle 
        <em>letter-spacing</em> enhances clarity. Typography transforms plain text into 
        a meaningful and enjoyable reading experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal is simple: create a <strong>visual flow</strong> that feels natural and balanced. 
        Whether you're designing a blog, magazine, or digital interface, remember that 
        <mark>good typography speaks louder than decoration</mark>.
